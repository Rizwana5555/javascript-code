The **Rock Paper Scissors Game** is a fun and interactive web-based game developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows users to play the classic hand game against a computer opponent. The game provides an engaging user interface with three selectable choices: **Rock, Paper, and Scissors**. Each choice is represented with an image, making the game visually appealing.  

When a player selects an option, the game generates a random choice for the computer using JavaScript's `Math.random()` function. The winner is determined based on the traditional rules:  
- Rock beats Scissors  
- Scissors beats Paper  
- Paper beats Rock  

If both the player and the computer choose the same option, the game results in a **draw**, and the message updates accordingly. The **scoreboard** keeps track of the number of rounds won by both the player and the computer, making the game competitive.  

The **design** of the game is simple yet effective, with a neatly styled layout using **CSS**. The choices are displayed as circular buttons that change color when hovered over, providing an interactive experience. The result message dynamically updates after every round, indicating whether the player **won, lost, or tied** the game.  

The JavaScript logic efficiently handles user interactions by listening for **click events** on the choices. It then updates the game status, calculates the winner, and modifies the **scoreboard** and **message display** accordingly. The background color of the message box also changes to green for a win, red for a loss, and remains blue for a draw, enhancing the **user experience**.  

Overall, this project serves as a great introduction to **DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic in JavaScript**. It is an excellent beginner-friendly project that demonstrates **basic programming concepts** in a fun and interactive way.
